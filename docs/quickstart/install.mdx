Aegiscan supports three deployment options:

- Docker Compose
- AWS Fargate via Terraform
- Kubernetes via Helm (coming soon)

### Docker Compose

<DeploymentNote />

Deploy a local Aegiscan stack using Docker Compose. View step-by-step instructions [here](https://docs.aegiscan.com/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker-compose).

```bash
# Download Aegiscan
git clone https://github.com/DigitransLab/aegiscan.git

# Generate .env file
./env.sh

# Run Aegiscan
docker compose up -d
```

<PublicUrlNote />

Check out the generated `.env` file to better understand Aegiscan's configurations.
You can also view the template `.env.example` file [here](https://github.com/DigitransLab/aegiscan/blob/0.27.3/.env.example).

### AWS Fargate

**For advanced users:** deploy a production-ready Aegiscan stack on AWS Fargate using Terraform. View step-by-step instructions [here](https://docs.aegiscan.com/self-hosting/deployment-options/aws-ecs).

```bash
# Download Terraform files
git clone https://github.com/DigitransLab/aegiscan.git
cd aegiscan/deployments/aws

# Create and add encryption keys to AWS Secrets Manager
./scripts/create-aws-secrets.sh

# Run Terraform to deploy Aegiscan
