<Note>
This tutorial assumes you have set `AEGISCAN__AUTH_TYPES=basic` in your `.env` file.
For production deployments, we highly recommend using [SAML SSO](/self-hosting/authentication/saml-sso) or [Google OAuth](/self-hosting/authentication/google-oauth).
</Note>

## Owner

The owner role is assigned to the first user who logs into Aegiscan. This user has admin rights to every workspace in the Aegiscan instance.

## Security

Define the `AEGISCAN__AUTH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` environment variable to restrict the email domains that can log into Aegiscan.
For example, to restrict access to email addresses from `aegiscan.com` and `example.com`, set the following:

```bash
AEGISCAN__AUTH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=aegiscan.com,example.com
```

## Login as admin

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Aegiscan">
    Go to the Aegiscan UI at `http://localhost` and click the `Sign up` button.

## Invite new users

To add new users to Aegiscan, the user must first sign-up to Aegiscan.
They will be redirected to the following page:

To invite the new user to a workspace, first log into Aegiscan as the admin, then follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Workspace members">
    Select the workspace you want to invite the user to, then under the settings menu, click `Manage members`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add workspace member">
    Click the `Add member` button, then enter the email address of the new user that signed up.
    ![Add workspace member](/img/quickstart/admin/add-member.png)
    The new user will show up as:
    ![Members list](/img/quickstart/admin/members-list.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login as new user">
    The new user can now log into Aegiscan using the email address and password they used to sign up.
    They will be redirected to the workspace they were invited to.

## Organization settings

Superadmins also have the ability to:

- View all users and sessions.
- View all workspaces and settings.
- Remove any non-superadmin user from any workspace.
- Revoke active sessions for any user.
